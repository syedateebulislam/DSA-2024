Summary->

1.A child object can call parent methods directly because it inherits them.

2.If a method is overridden in the child, calling it on the child object will
execute the child’s version by default.

3.To explicitly call the parent’s version of an overridden method,
use super.methodName() from within the child class.

4.When using a parent type reference pointing to a child object,
overridden methods will call the child’s version due to Java’s dynamic
dispatch system.

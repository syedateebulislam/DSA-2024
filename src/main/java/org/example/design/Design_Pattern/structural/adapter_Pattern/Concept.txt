Problem statement -

Service A -> Already have a controllers which GET/POST JSON data only

Service B -> Already have a controllers which GET/POST XML data only

Service B needs to communicate with service A via existing endpoints and vise versa?


Components of Adapter Design Pattern -->>

Below are the components of adapter design pattern:

Target Interface:
Defines the interface expected by the client.
It represents the set of operations that the client code can use.
It’s the common interface that the client code interacts with.

Adaptee:
The existing class or system with an incompatible interface that needs to be integrated into the new system.
It’s the class or system that the client code cannot directly use due to interface mismatches.

Adapter:
A class that implements the target interface and internally uses an instance of the adaptee
to make it compatible with the target interface. It acts as a bridge,
adapting the interface of the adaptee to match the target interface.

Client:
The code that uses the target interface to interact with objects.
It remains unaware of the specific implementation details of the adaptee and the adapter.
It’s the code that benefits from the integration of the adaptee into the system through the adapter.
